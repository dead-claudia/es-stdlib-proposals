# `itertools` module

Iterables are very pervasive in the language now. But there isn't anything like most Array methods available. There are also several things that'd be useful in general for iterables that, in some cases, don't necessarily make sense with arrays. Each of them are detailed with their related algorithm and rationale.

- [itertools.reject](reject.md)
- [itertools.size](size.md)
- [itertools.zip](zip.md)
- [itertools.concat](concat.md)
- [itertools.max](max.md)
- [itertools.min](min.md)
- [itertools.average](average.md)
- [itertools.sorted, itertools.sortedBy](sorted.md)

Note that the function styles may change depending on how the [pipeline operator proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator) goes.
